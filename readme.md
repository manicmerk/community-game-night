Project Title: Community Game Night

Project Purpose: To solve the ever present problem of finding your real life friends in their online spaces. Community Game Night is designed as a profile wallet of sorts, that will allow your friends to easily access your gamer ID for all of the myriad board and video gaming accounts you utilize these days. Long gone are the days of having to send text after text with each individual gaming account (Steam, Epic, Playstation, Xbox, Playdek, Asmodee, etc). Make life easier for you and your friends. 

Also designed to help you see what your friends are playing or have available to play, making scheduling community game nights easier.
